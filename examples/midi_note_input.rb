@clock << @arpeggiator

# By default the arpeggiator will be in "omni mode", reacting to notes received from all MIDI channels

# To only look at a single channel, set the input channel via Arpeggiator#rx_channel=
# Can also be passed in to the Arpeggiator constructor via the :rx_channel option

@arpeggiator.rx_channel = 0

# You can then call arp.rx_channel = nil or arp.omni_on to return it to omni mode
# (Diamond does not respond to MIDI Omni On/Off messages)

# It's also possible to set the channel that the arpeggiator will output on

@arpeggiator.tx_channel = 1

@clock.start(:focus => true)

# When you play notes, they will be sent to the arpeggiator the same way
# Arpeggiator#add is used in most of the other examples
